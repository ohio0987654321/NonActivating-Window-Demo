Great — I’ll review your revised implementation plan with those constraints in mind: targeting the latest macOS versions, no App Store distribution, and keeping SIP enabled.

I’ll assess whether your injection strategy is sufficiently robust for hardened Electron apps, confirm your process targeting assumptions, and evaluate your test methodology for completeness. I’ll get back to you shortly with a concise technical review.


# Injection Strategy Robustness

* **Hardened Runtime blocks standard DYLD injection.**  Modern Electron apps like Discord are usually code-signed with the hardened runtime enabled.  This means all `DYLD_*` environment variables are ignored and library validation is enforced.  In practice, *any* attempt to inject a custom dylib via a wrapper that relies on `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` or similar will fail unless the app’s code signature explicitly disables library validation.  In fact, injection frameworks (e.g. InjectionIII) explicitly require disabling “app sandbox” and “library validation” at build time to load code dynamically.  Since the tool cannot re-sign Discord or disable its hardened runtime, these protections will prevent automatic library-loading hacks and interposed loading.

* **Mach\_override / Fishhook hooking requires code already loaded.**  Techniques like mach\_override (patching in-memory function prologs) or fishhook (rewiring dyld symbols) only work *after* the process is already running your code.  But to run that code, you must first get it into the process.  Under hardened runtime, there is no official API to do this, and direct memory injection (`task_for_pid` etc.) is blocked for signed, hardened binaries.  Even if you could preload a small bootstrap (e.g. via a custom launcher), library validation would reject any non–Apple-signed dylib loaded at runtime.  In short, without disabling these protections (which we cannot), function interposition is extremely brittle.  In one analysis, it was noted that injection on macOS “works but you need to temporarily turn off … ‘sandbox’ and ‘library validation’ under the hardened runtime during development so it can dynamically load code”.  This implies that *in the wild*, such hooking would likely be refused by the OS.

* **Wrapper/launcher may propagate injection, but has limits.**  Using a custom wrapper to launch Discord could set up some state (e.g. environment vars, spawn hooks) before the real app runs.  However, because Discord’s code is hardened, the OS will strip most `DYLD_*` settings.  The only way to get code in is via explicit entitlements or by exploiting a vulnerability.  Wrapping could catch the initial `posix_spawn` to launch Discord’s main process (and even spawn it explicitly with a debugger port or modified arguments).  But without Apple’s special `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement, the main process won’t accept injected libraries.  Hooking `posix_spawn` inside the wrapper might allow the wrapper to intercept any child spawns (e.g. helper processes or renderer processes) and inject code there, but again that requires code already running with higher privilege.  In practice, std library functions like `fork/exec` or `posix_spawn` inside Discord will *not* let you insert a custom library unless the app allows it.

* **Fishhook vs. mach\_override tradeoffs:**  Fishhook is easier but only rewrites symbol lookups for functions already linked into an image, whereas mach\_override can patch any function prolog in memory.  However, neither bypasses code-sign protections.  For example, fishhook can intercept calls to `posix_spawn` or `execve` in **that process** once the library is loaded, but if you can’t load the library in the first place, it’s moot.  Even if injection succeeded, fishhook won’t catch calls made within the app’s own `libSystem` unless that code went through a dyld interposition table.  Mach\_override could, in theory, hook deeper, but it requires writing to protected memory pages.

* **Risks and limitations:**  Attempting this kind of injection can lead to instability or detection.  Without entitlements, the OS may terminate the process or refuse to launch if it sees unsanctioned code running.  Future macOS updates may tighten SIP and library validation further (as seen with issues like yabai’s scripting-addition on Sonoma).  Even if it “works” on one version, Apple’s not guaranteeing it.  There’s also a race condition risk: if Discord creates an NSWindow before your hook is in place, you might miss it entirely.  In short, the wrapper+hook approach is *technically possible* only under non-hardened conditions.  Under standard SIP/hardened settings, it’s very fragile.

* **Better alternatives:**  Since low-level injection is so restricted, consider non-invasive methods.  Electron’s built-in debugging protocol is one such path: launching Discord with a debug flag (e.g. `--inspect` or by enabling remote debugging) allows arbitrary JS execution in the main process.  Importantly, the hardened runtime does **not** disable the Node/Electron debugging pipes.  Red-team research has shown that even hardened, notarized apps “still expose the IPC debug functionality required for this type of injection”.  In practice, one could open Chrome’s devtools on Discord’s Node process and run JS that calls Electron’s BrowserWindow API.  This sidesteps dyld entirely.  The downside is it requires launching Discord with that flag and managing a separate protocol, but it is far more robust under SIP than unsanctioned dylib injection.

  AppleScript or Accessibility-based UI scripting is another alternative.  For example, you *could* tell an app to move or resize its windows via the AXUIElement APIs or a GUI AppleScript.  However, macOS requires the user to grant Accessibility permission to your controller app.  The app must also be scriptable or at least have a GUI structure you can traverse.  These methods can reposition or manipulate visible windows, but they **cannot** alter the app’s internal behavior (e.g. they can’t change window style masks or intercept events).  SIMBL/EasySIMBL-like plugin loaders are essentially obsolete: they rely on dropping a `.bundle` into `/Library/Application Support/SIMBL` or similar, which is blocked by SIP and library validation.  In short, user-level scripting (AppleEvents, AX) is safer but limited, and true code injection alternatives outside the debug port are few.

# Process Targeting Accuracy

* **Main process owns NSWindows.**  In Electron, the *main* process is responsible for creating and managing all top-level application windows via the `BrowserWindow` API.  Each BrowserWindow maps to an `NSWindow` under the hood on macOS.  As Electron’s docs state, “the main process’ primary purpose is to create and manage application windows with the BrowserWindow module”.  Even when a renderer calls `window.open` or submits a form with `target=_blank`, Electron funnels that through the main process (often via `webContents.setWindowOpenHandler`) which then allocates a new BrowserWindow.  In other words, *no* renderer process on its own will instantiate an NSWindow; it must ask the main process to do so.

* **Exceptions and special cases.**  There are few exceptions.  The main process may spawn helper processes (GPU, network, etc.) but these are non-UI utility processes and do not own NSWindows.  Even a sandboxed renderer is not permitted to create windows directly – it only has CPU/memory rights and must delegate privileged tasks (like window creation) to the main process via IPC.  Dialogs, panels, devtools windows, and so on are all still managed by the main process.  For example, Electron pairs each Chrome “window” with a BrowserWindow in main, and even embedded webviews or BrowserViews live inside an NSWindow provided by the main process.  In short, targeting the main Discord/Electron binary is the correct approach for intercepting NSWindow behavior.

* **Minor nuances.**  Some Electron apps may set parent/child relationships for windows (e.g. sheets, modal dialogs, utility panels), but those are still NSWindow subclasses attached by the main process.  If you hook or swizzle on `NSWindow` (or its subclasses), you will catch most on-screen windows.  (Note: NSPanel is a subclass of NSWindow, so a generic NSWindow hook will cover panels as well.)  The only caveat is windows that may be created extremely early (before your code is injected) might slip past initial hooks.  Testing should verify that even the first windows (e.g. splash screens or login dialogs) are captured.  But in general, Electron’s model is clear: **the main process owns all BrowserWindow-managed NSWindow instances**.

# Test Strategy Coverage

* **Basic injection tests.**  The proposed plan to start with simple injection (e.g. into a trivial Electron or non-hardened app) is sound.  Verify that your wrapper can launch a target process and that your library hooking code actually loads and patches a known function.  This catches low-level bugs before dealing with Discord’s complexity.

* **Hardened runtime scenario.**  You should explicitly test on an app that *does* have hardened runtime (code-signed with library validation).  For example, build a small macOS app with hardened runtime enabled and confirm that your injection fails or is blocked.  This will validate that environment/`DYLD_*` hacks are indeed stripped.  It will also show how the system reacts (e.g. logs about ignored DYLD vars, or immediate termination).  This step should confirm the limitations highlighted above.

* **Function-swizzling hooks.**  Once you have code running, test your actual Objective-C/swizzling logic on a benign window.  For example, launch a simple NSWindow-based test app and have your code swizzle `-[NSWindow setFrame:]` or similar, verifying that windows get modified as expected.  This confirms that mach\_override/fishhook behavior is correct.  Make sure to test on both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures (macOS 13/14) since pointer sizes and page protection can differ; ensure the hooking libraries you use support arm64 (many do nowadays).

* **Full modification tests.**  Apply the full “window modifier” logic (resize, restyle, reposition) in a controlled environment.  Try dragging or creating multiple windows to see if your changes persist.  Important edge cases to test here include: windows created *after* the app’s first run loop (dynamic/delayed creation); modal sheets or panels; and minimized or hidden windows.  Verify that if a new BrowserWindow opens (e.g. a user opens a new chat or settings window), it too gets modified.  Also test rapid open/close of windows, in case your hooks assume one-time execution.

* **Electron/Discord target tests.**  Finally, test on the real target.  Install Discord (or another Electron app) normally and launch it via your wrapper.  Step through the window lifecycle in both normal and fullscreen/mission-control contexts.  **Edge cases to include:**

  * **Sandboxed/Renderer contexts:** Although windows come from main, Electron 20+ uses sandboxed renderers by default.  Confirm that your modifications still apply when renderers are sandboxed (they should, since the main is making the window).  Testing this is usually implicit by running a current app.
  * **Delayed/dynamic windows:** Discord might open dialogs (e.g. “Add Server” or incoming call windows) some seconds after login.  Ensure your code catches these.
  * **Multiple displays and Spaces:** Check that if the user drags windows between monitors or Spaces, the modified properties (e.g. size, level) remain consistent.  In particular, verify Mission Control (Expose) behavior: if you change a window’s collection behavior or level, does it still appear correctly when the user enters Mission Control?  For example, setting a window to skip the mission-control grid could hide it inadvertently.  Test windows on different Spaces and with full-screen apps to ensure nothing breaks.
  * **Renderer-initiated windows:** Some apps open child windows from web content (e.g. OAuth login windows, image pop-outs).  These still come from main, but test them specifically.
  * **External processes:** If Discord spawns helper executables (e.g. a GPU process or updater), decide if they need injection.  Typically they do not own NSWindows, but confirm your posix\_spawn hooks if implemented. For instance, if a child process itself creates a Cocoa window (unlikely for Discord), your tools would need to handle that too.

* **Additional edge cases:**  Consider the following tests that might otherwise be overlooked:

  1. **App updates:** After injecting once, upgrade Discord to a new version (or simulate a new Electron version).  Re-run your tests to see if any hard-coded offsets or class names have changed.  Even if the hook logic is generic, OS or Electron changes could alter class structure.
  2. **Quarantine and permissions:** If Discord was downloaded from the internet, check how Gatekeeper/quarantine bits interact.  Your wrapper should preserve the app’s signature or properly re-sign any stub, else macOS may refuse to launch.
  3. **Background vs foreground:** Test when Discord is launched but its windows are not immediately visible (e.g. app launched in background, or with no active window until login).  Ensure your code doesn’t assume the window is already on-screen.
  4. **Installer vs App bundle:** If Discord updates via its own updater, make sure injection still works.  Some apps replace their own executable on update, which could break a pinned wrapper.
  5. **Accessibility/UI scripting interference:** If you support or rely on Accessibility, try toggling Accessibility permission and see if that changes anything.  (Mostly relevant if you use AX to catch windows.)

In summary, while the proposed progressive testing is good, pay special attention to timing and environment differences: hardened vs non-hardened, early vs late window creation, and cross-architecture behavior.  Test thoroughly on macOS 13/14 and on both x86\_64 and arm64 Discord builds.  Document any failures and adjust your injection timing or targets accordingly (for example, hooking an earlier initializer if a window is created too soon).
