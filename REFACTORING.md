# Window Modifier Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring performed on the window modifier project.

## Key Refactoring Changes

### 1. Centralized Type Definitions
- Created `src/core/common_types.h` to house all shared type definitions
- Reorganized types into logical sections with descriptive comments
- Eliminated duplicate type definitions across files
- Improved header organization with section separators

### 2. Universal Binary Support
- Enhanced architecture detection in injector.c with multiple fallback methods
- Added robust CPU detection that works on Intel and Apple Silicon
- Properly organized Makefile with architecture flags (x86_64, arm64, arm64e)
- Added architecture-aware code paths

### 3. Improved Header Organization
- Added proper forward declarations
- Fixed include hierarchies to avoid circular dependencies
- Used clearer module boundaries
- Enhanced documentation for all public interfaces

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error reporting
- Implemented proper fallback mechanisms
- Used defensive programming patterns
- Added more robust error recovery

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- Added consistent section headers for better readability
- More descriptive naming conventions
- Better documentation of CGS private APIs
- Improved thread safety

## File-Specific Changes

### src/core/common_types.h (New)
- Centralized location for all shared types
- Clear organization with section headers
- Platform-specific code properly isolated with preprocessor directives
- Complete documentation of CGS private APIs

### src/injector.c
- Added robust CPU architecture detection
- Enhanced process role detection
- More comprehensive error handling
- Better resource management

### src/operations/window_modifier.h
- Streamlined interface
- Better documentation
- Removed redundant type definitions
