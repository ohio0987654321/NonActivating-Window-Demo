# Window Modifier Refactoring Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to the Window Modifier project to improve code quality, readability, robustness, and add universal binary support.

## Completed Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Consolidated Type Definitions

- Created `common_types.h` to centralize all shared type definitions
- Removed duplicate typedefs across files
- Organized types into logical sections
- Updated all files to use the central type definitions

### 2. Added Universal Binary Support

- Updated Makefile to compile for multiple architectures (x86_64, arm64, arm64e)
- Added architecture detection in the injector for better compatibility
- Ensured proper architecture support in function loading and process management

### 3. Improved Forward Declarations

- Added proper forward declarations to avoid circular dependencies
- Structured header files to minimize include dependencies
- Made opaque type declarations more consistent

### 4. Enhanced Code Organization

- Better structured module interfaces
- Improved documentation and comments
- Added section headers for logical code grouping
- Made naming and coding styles more consistent

### 5. Improved Error Handling & Robustness

- Enhanced error handling in architecture detection
- Added fallback mechanisms for CPU detection
- Improved memory management and resource cleanup
- Added defensive programming patterns

## Architecture-Specific Improvements

### Injector Module

- Added robust CPU architecture detection with multiple fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced logging of system architecture information
- Improved detection of process types for better compatibility

### Core Module

- Consolidated type definitions for better maintenance
- Added proper interface between components
- Improved resource management

### CGS Module

- Updated to use common type definitions
- Improved header organization

### Operations Module

- Enhanced documentation
- Updated to use common types
- Better structure for swizzling operations

### Tracker Module

- Updated registry and classifier to use common types
- Improved interface documentation

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Consolidated types make future changes easier to manage
2. **Better Compatibility**: Universal binary support ensures compatibility across Mac models
3. **Enhanced Robustness**: Better error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Cleaner Code**: Better organization, documentation, and consistency
5. **Architecture Support**: Explicit support for x86_64, arm64, and arm64e

## Future Work

Additional improvements that could be made:

1. Further optimize architecture-specific code paths
2. Add more comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
3. Enhance logging for better diagnostics
4. Create more comprehensive testing across architectures
