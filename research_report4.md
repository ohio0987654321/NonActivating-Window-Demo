Thanks — with your clarified assumptions (full launch control, targeting hardened apps via wrapper, no runtime injection under SIP, and support for macOS 14+), I’ll now assess your hybrid injection architecture.

I’ll evaluate the realism and resilience of your Process Management, Injection Strategy, Window Interception, and Cross-Process Communication design in modern macOS environments. I’ll get back to you shortly with a detailed technical review.


# Hybrid Injection Architecture for macOS Applications

## Process Management Layer

Electron-based apps (like Discord) spawn multiple processes (main/browser, GPU, renderer, etc.). In Activity Monitor or `ps`, the main process typically appears as the app name (e.g. “Discord” or “Electron”), while helper processes often show names like “Discord Helper” or “Electron Helper”.  In practice, one can enumerate processes (e.g. via `proc_listpids`/`proc_pidinfo` or `sysctl`) and inspect their paths or arguments. However, macOS limits this: for example, `proc_pidinfo()` will only return details for your own processes unless run as root.  Consequently, an injector running as the same user may see most Discord processes (since they share a user session) but cannot use privileged APIs to distinguish them.  Instead, *heuristics* must suffice: for instance, Electron processes include a `--type=` command-line flag that identifies their role.  Windows examples show child processes launched with `--type=renderer` or `--type=browser`, and macOS Electron behaves similarly.  Thus, parsing `cmdline` for `--type=renderer` or checking the helper app bundle names can identify renderers vs the main GUI process.  However, these are implementation details of Chromium/Electron, not a public API, so they may change in future versions. In summary, process tracking must rely on what is visible (process name, executable path, launch args) and may require running as root to get full info.  It is technically possible to track parent/child relationships (the wrapper could fork/exec and record child PIDs), but once Electron spawns internal helpers, those will need similar injection logic in each child.

## Injection Strategy Viability

By design this architecture uses launch-time injection (e.g. setting `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` or patching the binary) rather than attaching to a running process.  On modern macOS, **System Integrity Protection (SIP)** and the **Hardened Runtime** block most runtime injection. In fact, Apple explicitly prohibits *“code injection using DYLD environment variables”* in hardened processes.  Since macOS 10.12, SIP ignores `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` for Apple-signed (“platform”) binaries, and since 10.14 the Hardened Runtime enforces strict library validation. This means a signed and hardened app (like Discord) will not load any injected dylib unless certain conditions are met.

However, if we have **full launch control via a wrapper**, we can work around these blocks by re-signing or disabling hardening.  For example, resigning the app with a custom developer certificate and adding the **`com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables`** entitlement will disable the runtime’s environment-variable scrubbing. In that case, we can set `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` in the wrapper’s launch environment to load our injection dylib. Crucially, the injected dylib itself **must be signed with the same certificate** as the app (or with appropriate entitlements), or library validation will reject it. One experiment showed that a hardened app will refuse a foreign dylib (“no suitable image found”) unless the dylib is signed by the same team ID as the app.

*The figure above illustrates a typical launch-time injection: a “stager” wrapper patches the target Mach-O (on disk or in memory) to load a malicious dylib, then forks and execs the app so that the injected library runs in the new process.*

If we **cannot re-sign** or disable the Hardened Runtime, then DYLD-based injection simply fails. Known restrictions in macOS 14 (Sonoma) are largely continuations of these policies, not new rules: notarized apps still run with hardened runtime by default, and system enforcement of entitlements has been consistent. No public report suggests a new Sinatra-style block specific to Sonoma beyond what already exists. In practice, remaining resilient likely means *always* shipping with a custom signature and `allow-dyld` if injection is needed.

A **hybrid fallback** approach (multiple injection methods) can add robustness, but cannot override core protections. Potential methods include: (a) **Environment injection** via `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` in each launch (our primary path); (b) **Mach-O patching**, where the wrapper directly alters the app binary (or helper executable) on disk to load our code (similar to the stager flow above); (c) **Custom loader hack**, such as using `DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX` or `DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE` (though these are also governed by hardened rules). Traditional runtime injection (like using `task_for_pid`+`mach_inject`) is essentially impossible on hardened apps without disabling SIP. In summary: if the app is re-signed with matching signature and entitlements, launcher-based DYLD injection is viable. Without that, the architecture would fail to inject into a hardened/SIP-protected app. Even a multi-method strategy can only succeed if one of the methods (usually the launcher path with resign) is allowed.

## Window Interception and Modification

Once injected, the code needs to hook into each process’s UI framework. On macOS most windows are instances of **NSWindow** (AppKit), even in frameworks like Electron or Tauri. By swizzling methods in `NSWindow` (for example overriding `-initWithContentRect:styleMask:...` or `-makeKeyAndOrderFront:`) or observing `NSWindowDidBecomeKey/DidExpose` notifications, the injected code can detect and modify new windows as they appear. This generally works across AppKit-based frameworks, including Electron (which uses Cocoa under the hood), Tauri (which embeds a `WKWindow` inside NSWindow), or any app that uses native windows. A good strategy is to implement a common “window interceptor” in the dylib, possibly with a Strategy/Adapter pattern: for each process type, the interceptor sets up the swizzle or notification, and a small piece of code customizes the window (e.g. adjusting style or inserting overlays). For example, one might swizzle `-[NSWindow initWithContentRect:styleMask:...]` to run custom code on each new window.

**Potential pitfalls:** Care must be taken if multiple libraries or categories attempt the same swizzle. If each injected dylib (in different processes) uses identical category names, there is no cross-process conflict (each process is isolated). But within one process, if the code path somehow loads two injection libraries, they could collide; so typically one ensures only one dylib per process does the swizzling. Also, because Objective-C method replacement is global per process, one should call the original implementation from the swizzled method and avoid interfering with unrelated code. Another concern is that frameworks could change; for instance, if future versions of Electron use different window initialization routines, the hook might miss them. However, NSWindow swizzling is fairly broad and should catch most Cocoa windows. In short, hooking NSWindow at load time is reliable today, but should be done with well-namespaced selectors and by merging logic into a single hook per process to avoid category conflicts.

## Cross-Process Coordination and IPC

Synchronizing multiple injected processes (main and helpers) requires an IPC layer. Options include **XPC**, **Mach ports**, or even simple POSIX mechanisms. For example, one process could host an XPC service and others connect to it to exchange state (like theme settings or messages to apply). XPC is secure and Apple-supported, but requires defining an interface and signing entitlements if needed. Alternatively, Mach messaging (using a known service name) can be used without higher-level bindings, but is more low-level. Even `NSDistributedNotificationCenter` or a named `UserDefaults` entry could be used for lightweight signals. In either case, code in each process must establish the channel early (e.g. in `+load`).

The challenge is timing: Electron’s model is asynchronous. If, for example, the main process’s injection needs to tell each renderer to tweak its windows *before* they show, the renderer must wait or intercept its window-creation hook until it hears from main. This might involve some startup handshaking. In practice, modifications can often happen on window creation hooks independently, but if any state (like a shared color or layout) must be consistent, messages must propagate quickly. Overall, XPC or Mach-based communication is *possible* and commonly used by multiprocess Cocoa apps, but careful design is needed to avoid race conditions. For example, injecting a pre-activation tweak may require blocking a renderer’s UI thread until an IPC message arrives. In summary, a dedicated XPC service (or Mach port) per app can reliably sync state, but one must design for the asynchronous nature of Electron’s processes to ensure no window appears unmodified due to IPC lag.

## macOS Compatibility and Long-Term Viability

As Apple hardens macOS further, this hybrid injection model remains **fragile**. Apple has signaled that hardened runtime and SIP are core security features – e.g. it forbids unsigned library loading and disallows almost all runtime code injection. Public injection tools like MIP demonstrate that injection on Sonoma is still *technically* possible, but only with SIP disabled. In other words, with normal security settings our approach can only work by resigning or obtaining entitlements on the target app. If Apple ever mandates hardened runtime for all third-party apps (or further restricts dynamic linking), then launcher-based injection may become impossible without disabling protections globally.

There is no widely-accepted hack to bypass SIP+Hardened for a specific app except re-signing. Only privileged or kernel exploits can force injection, which are outside the scope here. No public API nor Apple-supported mechanism exists for loading custom code into an arbitrary hardened app. Therefore, the best one can do is *future-proof* by minimizing reliance on fragile behavior: keep swizzling and IPC code very light, detect and adapt to OS changes, and ensure any injected dylib is always correctly signed/entitled. Regularly monitoring macOS release notes for new entitlements (e.g. `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`) is prudent. If possible, delegating as much logic as possible to the existing app code (for instance, using Electron’s own IPC or theming APIs) can reduce dependence on injection.

**Conclusion:** In summary, this architecture can work on current macOS versions for a hardened app like Discord **only if** the launcher re-signs the app with the appropriate entitlements and loads signed dylibs. It benefits from full launch control, but must carefully address Apple’s restrictions. The strengths are that method-swizzling and process enumeration are well-understood techniques; the weaknesses lie in Apple’s security model. Mitigations include resigning, using entitlements (e.g. allow-dyld), and avoiding parallel swizzles. Ongoing maintenance will be required to adapt to future macOS tightening, but with those precautions the approach is technically feasible today.

**Sources:** In addition to the references above, Apple’s documentation and analysis have confirmed that hardened runtime disallows environment-dylib injection by default, that injected code must be signed by the same team, and that tools like MIP achieve injection only with SIP disabled. These inform the assessment of long-term viability.
