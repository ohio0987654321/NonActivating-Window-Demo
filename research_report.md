# Technical Review of Multi-Process Window Injection Architecture

## Flaws in the Proposed Approach

* **Injection into Child Processes Is Fragile:**  Modern macOS apps (including Electron-based apps like Discord) typically enable the Hardened Runtime and library validation.  As a result, traditional injection methods (e.g. setting `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`) are ignored.  System Integrity Protection (SIP) also prevents code injection into Apple-signed processes.  In practice, an Electron app’s executables are usually signed and hardened, so environment-based injection will likely be blocked.  (For example, Cisco Talos found that Microsoft Teams and other apps disabled library validation to *allow* plugins; otherwise injection is “relatively easy” only if validation is turned off.)  Thus any plan that assumes children will pick up injected libraries at launch will fail on hardened apps.

* **Over-Injection & Unnecessary Targets:**  In Electron, the **main process** creates and manages all NSWindow instances via the `BrowserWindow` module.  Renderer processes draw web content but typically do *not* own the native windows themselves.  Injecting into *every* child process (GPU, utilities, renderer, etc.) adds complexity without clear benefit for window-level hooks.  In fact, focusing on injecting the main process is often sufficient to modify application windows; renderer processes usually only need injection if you plan to alter DOM or JavaScript-level behavior.  The architecture should avoid “shotgun” injection into every child PID and instead target processes by role.

* **Process-Type Detection May Be Unreliable:**  The plan likely relies on heuristics (process name, environment flags) to distinguish main vs helper vs renderer.  This can be brittle: process names may change (e.g. “Electron Helper (Renderer)”), and environment variables (like those Electron sets) might not be exposed to injected code.  A more robust method is to examine `NSProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments` or known command-line flags (e.g. Electron’s `--type=renderer`) after injection.  Without reliable detection, injection code might activate incorrectly or miss the intended target.  If the plan uses NSWorkspace notifications to catch new PIDs, note that background-only apps (LSUIElement=1) do *not* emit launch notifications, so any helper agents must be regular apps or daemons.

* **Strategy Pattern Might Be Overkill or Misapplied:**  Encapsulating window-modification logic in a “strategy” object per window type can be good design, but in an injected context it adds overhead.  Each process would need to load and manage multiple strategy instances, increasing memory footprint and complexity.  Moreover, the choice of strategy often depends on window class or role at runtime; a simpler dispatch table or even a single handler for `NSWindow` subclasses might suffice.  If the plan’s strategy pattern is implemented using Objective-C classes (categories/protocols), ensure that class names don’t collide or get stripped.  The design should remain lean: e.g. a single `WindowModifier` that inspects the window’s attributes and applies rules may be easier to maintain than dozens of “strategy” classes.

* **Window Discovery Mechanisms are Limited:**  If the plan enumerates windows from one process (e.g. using `[NSApp windows]`), it will only find windows owned by that process.  Global enumeration (e.g. `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo`) can list windows from all apps, but it only provides IDs and metadata, not actual `NSWindow` objects.  Modifying a window requires code running *inside* the owning process (or using Accessibility).  Simply using `CGWindowList` in one process won’t let you alter another app’s window.  If the plan uses Accessibility APIs (`AXUIElement`) to find windows, that requires special permissions (and has its own limitations on custom window classes).  In short, external discovery (CGWindowList/AX) can *find* windows by PID and title, but to *modify* them you generally must be executing code in that process’s address space.  The architecture should clarify this: either inject code that hooks window creation events in each relevant process, or rely on AX calls (with permission) to move/resize windows externally.

## Alternative Techniques

* **Process Monitoring:**  Instead of ad-hoc scanning, use system notifications or hooks.  macOS’s `NSWorkspace.shared.notificationCenter` posts `didLaunchApplicationNotification` and `didTerminateApplicationNotification` when apps start/stop.  A helper agent can listen for these to detect new child processes (though LSUIElement apps won’t trigger them).  Alternatively, a Launch Daemon/Agent (launchd) can monitor or even spawn the target app with a custom environment.  For intercepting *within* a process, you can use function interposition (e.g. fishhook) to hook `execve` or `posix_spawn` so that whenever the Electron binary spawns a helper process, you insert your code.  Tools like the [FishHook](https://github.com/ConradSun/FishHook) repackaging library explicitly support injecting a dylib that hooks spawn calls to capture child processes.  In summary, robust monitoring may combine high-level APIs (NSWorkspace/NSRunningApplication) with low-level hooks (execve interception) to ensure no process is missed.

* **Dynamic Swizzling/Hooks:**  Once inside a process, use Objective-C runtime hooks.  At load time (e.g. in `+load`), one can swizzle key AppKit methods or register for notifications.  For example, override `-[NSWindow initWithContentRect:styleMask:...]` or observe `NSWindowDidBecomeMainNotification` to adjust window styles on creation.  The [OSX\_Swizzler](https://github.com/Fuzion24/OSX_Swizzler) and mach\_inject libraries show how injected bundles can method-swap Cocoa classes to alter behavior.  The Aspects library (or manually using `method_exchangeImplementations`) can intercept calls like `-[NSWindow orderFront:]` or `-[NSWindow setTitle:]`.  As an alternative, subclassing is possible if you can substitute your subclass for the one in the NIB, but that is more brittle.  In general, swizzling in the injected dylib is the standard macOS pattern for runtime modification of windows or controls.

* **Accessibility API Fallback:**  If injection into a process isn’t feasible, macOS’s Accessibility (AX) APIs allow one process to move/resize another app’s windows (with user consent).  For example, you can call `AXUIElementCreateApplication(pid)` and then `AXUIElementSetAttributeValue(windowRef, kAXPositionAttribute, newPosition)` to move a window.  This approach avoids code injection but requires the user to grant Accessibility permissions.  It also cannot do complex UI customization beyond moving, resizing, and simulating input.  It’s best used as a last resort or for simple adjustments.

* **Electron-Specific Hooks:**  Because Electron apps can be launched with a Node context, one trick (for non-UI code) is setting the environment variable `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`, which causes the app to run a Node.js REPL instead of the GUI.  This can bypass some restrictions (e.g. TCC permissions) and let you run arbitrary NodeJS code under the app’s identity.  However, it effectively kills the UI, so it’s not suitable for a “live” window modifier.  It is mentioned here as a proof-of-concept for payload delivery, not a recommendation for UI tweaks.

## Implementation Prioritization and Testing

* **Core Injection Framework First:**  The first component to implement should be a reliable injection mechanism into the Electron main process.  Validate that your code can attach to Discord’s main binary and run arbitrary code (for example, by logging or changing the window title).  This confirms that your injection bypasses signing/SIP (perhaps by re-signing with an ad-hoc cert or using a helper/executable injection approach).  Next, implement process-monitoring logic so that if Discord spawns a new helper (renderer) process, your injector also attaches to it.

* **Window Hooking Logic:**  Once injection is confirmed, focus on hooking NSWindow creation or notifications.  For example, swizzle `-[NSWindow initWithContentRect:...]` or listen for `NSWindowDidBecomeMainNotification`, then apply your style changes.  Test this in a simple Electron app first (e.g. a minimal “Hello World” browser window) before tackling Discord.  This ensures the modification strategy works in a controlled environment.

* **Progressive Tests to Reduce Risk:**  1) **Injection Test:** Load a dummy dylib into a test app (unrelated to Electron) to ensure your injection pipeline (mach\_inject, launcher, etc.) is solid.  2) **Basic Hook Test:** In an injected process, simply swizzle an `NSWindow` method (like setting the title) and verify it takes effect.  3) **Multi-Process Test:** Launch multiple child processes and ensure your process-monitor catches them (e.g. by having the child log a message upon load).  4) **Electron Test:** Try injecting into a known Electron app (e.g. VS Code or a custom Electron build) to refine environment detection.  5) **Discord Test:** Finally, apply to Discord itself and test window discovery and modification.  Each step should have automated checks (logs or visible UI changes) to confirm success.

* **Risk Reduction:**  Early on, verify assumptions: confirm that Discord’s windows truly exist in the main process (per [Electron docs](#)).  If not, adjust strategy.  Also check code signing/hardened status of the target (e.g. with `codesign -dvv`).  If library validation is enabled, your injection may require code signing workarounds or an alternative hook (like an external plugin).

## Additional Considerations

* **macOS Security Limits:**  Be aware of privacy and security controls.  Code injection into another app can be blocked by the sandbox or TCC if you try to do something sensitive.  GUI element modification itself isn’t explicitly blocked, but if you later attempt actions like screen capture or input injection, you’ll hit privacy prompts.  Keep the injected code’s scope minimal.  Also note that 32-bit apps (rare on Discord) cannot be injected by 64-bit dylibs and vice versa.  On Apple Silicon, you must inject a universal dylib or a matching-arch library.

* **Electron Sandbox & Renderer Restrictions:**  Recent Electron versions put sandboxing on renderers by default.  Injecting into a sandboxed renderer is more difficult (it has stricter `posix_spawn` flags and disallows loading external modules).  If Discord uses sandboxed renderers, consider whether you really need to inject there.  Often, UI windows are controlled by the main process, so you might skip sandboxed processes entirely.  If you do inject into renderers, verify that your code has the `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only` entitlement or similar if it needs to load resources.

* **Inter-Process Communication:**  If your architecture involves multiple injected components that must coordinate (e.g. main injector telling renderer injector what to do), use an IPC mechanism.  Apple’s **XPC services** are the recommended IPC for macOS.  You can bundle an XPC helper with your injector or use a “rendezvous” (launchd plist) to connect two unrelated processes.  XPC lets one side have a proxy object to the other, so you can simply call a method on the proxy and the code runs in the target process.  Alternatively, simpler mechanisms like `NSNotificationCenter` (on `NSUserDefaults` via CFDistributedNotificationCenter) or even sockets/pipes could work, but XPC is more robust and secure.

* **Known Examples and Best Practices:**  Existing tools like [SIMBL](https://github.com/SIMBL/SIMBL) (though outdated) and [mach\_inject/mach\_override](https://github.com/rentzsch/mach_inject) demonstrate how to load code into Cocoa apps at runtime.  Look at open-source macOS customization utilities (e.g. BetterTouchTool’s Objective-C injection for touch gestures) for patterns.  Always test on the latest macOS version, as each update can change injection surface (for example, newer macOS versions have tightened dyld loading rules).

By carefully modularizing these components and validating each step with tests, the proof-of-concept can evolve into a stable multi-process window modifier. The keys are respecting macOS’s security model (citing known limitations), leveraging correct APIs for monitoring and hooking, and minimizing unnecessary complexity (e.g. only injecting where windows actually live).
